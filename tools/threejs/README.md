### Use Three.js

1. Navigate to the `tools/threejs` directory with `cd tools/threejs`.
2. Minify your `02_main.js` file and save it as `compressed-inputs/02_main.min.js`.
    - If you have `minify` installed, run `minify 02_main.js > compressed-inputs/02_main.min.js` in the terminal.
    - If you don't have `minify`, just put the js code in `compressed-inputs/02_main.min.js` directly.
3. Run `make clean && make` in the terminal.
4. Your final file for inscribing will be `index.html`.
5. For local testing, open `index.local.html` (generated by the same `make` command).

Notes:
- Only the core Three.js bundle is injected by the template. If you want to use
  helpers like `GLTFLoader`, you must inline the loader code in your
  `02_main.js` (or otherwise bundle it into the compressed script).
