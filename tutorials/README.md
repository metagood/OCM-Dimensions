# Tutorials

Use these walkthroughs to get a complete, end-to-end feel for the OCM Dimensions workflow.

## Primer: what you're building

These tutorials assume you're creating tiny, recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin. Ordinals let you attach data (HTML, JS, media) to a satoshi, and recursion lets your inscription fetch shared on-chain libraries at render time. That shared library model is what makes OCM Dimensions possible at such small sizes while still enabling rich 3D and generative art.

1. [Compress a full HTML page](compress-html.md)
2. [Build a Three.js inscription](threejs.md)
3. [Build a p5.js inscription](p5js.md)

If you want a fast, in-browser workflow with no terminal, open `tools/browserUI/index.html` and compile from there.
