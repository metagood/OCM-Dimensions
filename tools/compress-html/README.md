### Compress HTML

1. Navigate to the `tools/compress-html` directory with `cd tools/compress-html`.
2. Place your `.html` file in the `input` directory.
3. Run `make clean && make` in the terminal.
4. Your compressed file for inscribing will be `index.html`.
5. For local testing, open `index.local.html` (generated by the same `make` command).
