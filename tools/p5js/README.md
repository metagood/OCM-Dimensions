### Use p5.js

1. Navigate to the `tools/p5js` directory with `cd tools/p5js`.
2. Put your js code in `input/02_main.js`.
3. Run `make clean && make` in the terminal.
4. Your final file for inscribing will be `index.html`.
5. For local testing, open `index.local.html` (generated by the same `make` command).
